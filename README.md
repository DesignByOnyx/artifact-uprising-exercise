## About this application

### Server

The server project is built with and generated by [feathersjs](https://feathersjs.com/). It is a lightweight, real-time enabled NodeJS API server which uses an in-memory database to allow ease of installation. This can be easily converted to one of nearly [a dozen database engines](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/databases/adapters.html) later thanks to feather's architecture.

### Client

The client application is built with react and was generated using `npx create-react-app`.
